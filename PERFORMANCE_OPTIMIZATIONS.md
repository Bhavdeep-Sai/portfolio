# Portfolio Performance Optimizations

## Overview
This document outlines the performance optimizations implemented to resolve lag and glitches during scrolling and component loading.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Particle Animation Performance
**Problem**: Heavy canvas operations running continuously at 60fps
**Solutions**:
- Reduced frame rate from 60fps to 30fps
- Capped device pixel ratio to 2 for better performance
- Reduced particle count and connection distance
- Added intersection observer to pause animations when not visible
- Disabled image smoothing for better canvas performance
- Used viewport height instead of full document height

### 2. Three.js Scene Optimization
**Problem**: Complex 3D scene with multiple shadows and high-poly model
**Solutions**:
- Disabled shadows on mobile devices
- Reduced shadow map size from 1024x1024 to 512x512
- Lowered lighting intensity values
- Added `Suspense` wrapper with loading component
- Implemented `frameloop="demand"` for on-demand rendering
- Memoized camera and lighting configurations
- Simplified 3D model by removing non-essential objects

### 3. Animation Performance
**Problem**: Too many simultaneous framer-motion animations
**Solutions**:
- Replaced spring animations with tween for better performance
- Reduced animation durations and delays
- Memoized animation variants
- Added React.memo to all components
- Implemented hardware acceleration with `will-change` CSS property
- Reduced hover scale effects

### 4. Image Loading Optimization
**Problem**: No lazy loading strategy causing render blocking
**Solutions**:
- Added lazy loading to all images
- Implemented critical resource preloading
- Used `requestIdleCallback` for non-critical resource prefetching
- Added proper alt attributes for accessibility
- Optimized image loading priority

### 5. Scroll Performance
**Problem**: Multiple unthrottled scroll listeners
**Solutions**:
- Implemented proper scroll throttling with requestAnimationFrame
- Debounced scroll visibility checks
- Reduced scroll thresholds for better responsiveness
- Added passive event listeners
- Used intersection observer where appropriate

### 6. CSS Performance
**Problem**: Missing hardware acceleration and containment
**Solutions**:
- Added `will-change` properties for animated elements
- Implemented CSS containment with `contain: layout style paint`
- Optimized hover transitions
- Added hardware acceleration with `transform: translateZ(0)`
- Improved font rendering with antialiasing

### 7. Component Memoization
**Problem**: Unnecessary re-renders causing performance issues
**Solutions**:
- Wrapped all components with React.memo
- Memoized expensive calculations with useMemo
- Optimized prop drilling and callback functions
- Implemented proper key props for list items

### 8. Bundle Optimization
**Problem**: Large bundle size affecting initial load
**Solutions**:
- Configured Vite for optimal chunking
- Split vendor libraries into separate chunks
- Enabled tree-shaking for unused code
- Optimized dependency pre-bundling
- Configured modern browser targets

## Performance Improvements

### Before Optimizations:
- Particle animation: 60fps with 100+ particles
- Canvas rendering: Full document height
- 3D scene: Full shadows on all devices
- Animations: Heavy spring physics
- Images: Synchronous loading
- Scroll: Multiple unthrottled listeners

### After Optimizations:
- Particle animation: 30fps with 20-50 particles
- Canvas rendering: Viewport height only
- 3D scene: Conditional shadows, optimized lighting
- Animations: Lightweight tween animations
- Images: Lazy loading with preloading
- Scroll: Throttled with passive listeners

## Browser Support
- Modern browsers (ES2015+)
- Hardware acceleration enabled
- Responsive design maintained
- Mobile-specific optimizations

## Development Experience
- Hot Module Replacement (HMR) enabled
- Fast Refresh for React components
- Error overlay disabled for better UX
- Source maps in development only

## Monitoring
- Performance can be monitored using browser DevTools
- React DevTools for component analysis
- Lighthouse for overall performance metrics

## Future Optimizations
1. Consider implementing virtual scrolling for large lists
2. Add service worker for caching strategies
3. Implement code splitting for route-based chunks
4. Consider using Web Workers for heavy computations
5. Add performance monitoring and analytics

## Usage
The optimizations are automatically applied. No additional configuration needed.
Just run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

For production build:

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Notes
- All animations maintain visual quality while improving performance
- Accessibility features are preserved
- Responsive design is maintained across all device sizes
- SEO optimization is not affected
